# 🕵️‍♂️ Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using Machine Learning models.  
It uses **EDA, PCA visualization, and classification algorithms** to identify fraud patterns.


## 🧠 Problem Statement

With the rapid growth of digital payments, credit card fraud has become a major concern for financial institutions and customers. Traditional rule-based detection methods often fail to identify sophisticated fraudulent patterns hidden in large-scale transaction data. This project aims to build a machine learning–based fraud detection system that can accurately classify transactions as genuine or fraudulent, helping reduce financial losses and enhance transaction securit
